# SourceCodeAnalysis

This project is a Streamlit web application that allows users to clone a public GitHub repository containing Python source code, process the code files using Langchain and OpenAI embeddings, and then ask questions about the code to get AI-generated answers.

The main purpose of this app is to enable interactive exploration and understanding of the source code in any GitHub repository without manually reading all the files. It helps users quickly get insights about the codebase by querying it naturally.

How to use the app:

Enter your OpenAI API key in the provided input box. This key is used to access OpenAI models for embeddings and language generation.

Enter the HTTPS URL of the GitHub repository you want to explore.

Click the "Clone and Index Repo" button. The app will clone the repository locally, load all Python files, split the code into manageable chunks, generate vector embeddings, and build a FAISS vectorstore for similarity search.

After indexing, you can type questions about the codebase in the query box and receive answers generated by the OpenAI language model using the retrieved relevant code context.

You can clear the session to reset and start over with a new repository or API key.

How it works internally:
The app first clones the repository to a local folder. It then loads all Python files using Langchain's DirectoryLoader. The source code files are split into smaller overlapping chunks to improve retrieval accuracy. OpenAI embeddings convert these chunks into high-dimensional vector representations which are stored in a FAISS vector index for fast similarity searches. A ChatOpenAI language model is combined with this retriever in a RetrievalQA chain, which retrieves relevant code snippets based on the user query and generates an AI response grounded in those snippets. This architecture allows the app to answer complex questions about the code by leveraging semantic search and generative AI.

Overall, this tool provides an intuitive and powerful interface to explore and understand GitHub source code repositories with the help of modern AI technologies.
